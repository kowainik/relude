#### Create a PR
We love receiving pull requests from everyone. But, please, don't create a PR
without a corresponding issue. It's always better to discuss your future
work first. Even if such an issue exist it's still better to express your willing

To get started with this you should first fork, then clone the repo:

#### :white_check_mark: Check list
- [ ] Project compiles
- [ ] New/fixed features work as expected
- [ ] Old features do not break after the change
- [ ] _Recommended:_ Commit messages are in the proper format. If the commit
  addresses an issue start the first line of the commit with the issue number in
  square parentheses.
  + **_Example:_** `[#42] Short commit description`

If you fix bugs or add new features, please add tests.

After everything above is done, commit and push to your fork.
