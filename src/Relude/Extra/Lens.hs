This module aims to provide a minimal implementation of @lens@ package required
for basic usage. All functions are compatible with the real @lens@ package
therefore if you need to expand to the full version the process should be
straightforward.

== Usage

To use lenses in your project, you don't need to add any other dependency rather
than @relude@. You should add the import of this module in the place of lenses
usage:

@
__import__ Relude.Extra.Lens
@

== Example

To understand better how to use this module lets look at some simple example.
Let's say we have the user data type in our system:

@
__data__ User = User
    { userName    :: 'Text'
    , userAge     :: 'Int'
    , userAddress :: Address
    } __deriving__ ('Show')

__data__ Address = Address
    { addressCountry :: 'Text'
    , addressCity    :: 'Text'
    , addressIndex   :: 'Text'
    } __deriving__ ('Show')
@

To create the lens for the @userName@ field we can use 'lens' function and manually writing getter and setter function:

@
nameL :: 'Lens'' User 'Text'
nameL = 'lens' getter setter
  __where__
    getter :: User -> 'Text'
    getter = userName

    setter :: User -> 'Text' -> User
    setter user newName = user {userName = newName}
@

In this manner, we can create other lenses for our User data type.

@
ageL     :: 'Lens'' User 'Int'
addressL :: 'Lens'' User Address
countryL :: 'Lens'' User 'Text'
cityL    :: 'Lens'' User 'Text'
indexL   :: 'Lens'' User 'Text'
@

/Note:/ here we are using composition of the lenses for @userAddress@ field. If we have

@
adressCityL :: 'Lens'' Address 'Text'
@

then

@
cityL = addressL . adressCityL
@

Let's say we have some sample user

@
user :: User
user = User
    { userName = \"John\"
    , userAge  = 42
    , userAddress = Address
        { addressCountry = \"UK\"
        , addressCity    = \"London\"
        , addressIndex   = \"XXX\"
        }
    }
@

To view the fields of the User data type we can use 'view' or '^.'

@
__>>>__ 'view' ageL user
42
__>>>__ user '^.' cityL
\"London\"
@

If we want to change any of the user's data, we should use 'set' or '.~'

@
__>>>__ 'set' nameL \"Johnny\" user
__>>>__ user '&' indexL '.~' \"YYY\"
@

'over' or '%~' operator could be useful when, for example, you want to increase the age by one on the user's birthday:

@
__>>>__ 'over' ageL 'succ' user
__>>>__ user '&' ageL '%~' 'succ'
@

== Migration

This module is not supposed to be the replacement for the @lens@ package. One of
the reasons why one would want to migrate to @lens@ or @microlens@ is that the
functional in @relude@ is limited to just vital lens functions.

To migrate to @lens@ or @microlens@ package add the required library to the
dependencies list in the @.cabal@ file and replace the import from @relude@
library

@
__import__ Relude.Extra.Lens
@

to the one of this correspondingly:

- @lens@:

    @
    __import__ Control.Lens
    @

- @microlens@:

    @
    __import__ Lens.Micro
    @

And that's all! No need to change the types or implementation of the functions
you used @Relude.Extra.Lens@ in.
