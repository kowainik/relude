Functions to remove duplicates from a list.

 = Performance
 To check the performance there was done a bunch of benchmarks.
 Benchmarks were made on lists of 'Prelude.Int's and 'Data.Text.Text's.
 There were two types of list to use:

 * Lists which consist of many different elements

 * Lists which consist of many same elements


 Here are some recomendations for usage of particular functions based on benchmarking resutls.

 * 'hashNub' is faster than 'ordNub' when there're not so many different values in the list.

 * 'hashNub' is the fastest with 'Data.Text.Text'.

 * 'sortNub' has better performance than 'ordNub' but should be used when sorting is also needed.

 * 'unstableNub' has better performance than 'hashNub' but doesn't save the original order.
